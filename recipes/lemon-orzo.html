    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Have you ever wondered, “what is orzo?” It may seem like a grain, such as rice or risotto. It does look like the two, and it captures and holds the ingredients it is cooked with. But it is a pasta (and something of a shape shifter) because it can play the role of rice or risotto depending on the recipe. Orzo is used for more brothy style pastas, so a meal with orzo comes together when cooked with liquids, fats, and acids.</p>

    <p>In this recipe, the orzo is first toasted with butter, bringing out the nutty flavor, and then cooked in lemon zest, chicken stock, salt, and garlic powder. The orzo is then transferred to a bowl and finished with lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, a little more butter, and additional lemon zest if desired. You end up with a bright, comfy bowl with great texture.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked orzo</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced and zested, divided</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspooon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Add orzo, and cook, stirring occasionally, until light golden and toasted,
                about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken stock, 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest, salt, and garlic powder. Bring to a simmer over medium-low.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, until orzo is al dente and most of the stock is evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, and fold in 2 tablespoons lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, and remaining 1 tablespoon butter until butter is melted. Garnish with parsley and additional lemon zest.</li>
