    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Korean spicy chicken rice noodle bake is not only my new favorite spicy chicken, itâ€™s also my new favorite way to cook rice noodles. Chicken is marinated briefly in a gochujang marinade, then dry rice vermicelli goes directly into the baking dish, chicken thighs are placed on top, and the dish bakes quickly to perfection. As a bonus, the leftovers can be served cold on greens for an amazing salad.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chili paste), or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bake</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>6 large skinless boneless chicken thighs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil for greasing baking dish</li>
                <li>8 ounces vermicelli rice noodles</li>
                <li>2 cups hen of the woods mushrooms, or sliced brown mushrooms</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sliced Fresno chili peppers, or any other peppers</li>
                <li>1 cup sliced green onions, divided</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups chicken broth</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Dressing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds for garnish (optional)</li>
               
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add ginger and garlic to a mixing bowl, and pour over the 1/4 cup rice vinegar. Let sit for 30 seconds, then whisk in soy sauce, salt, brown sugar, ketchup, the 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and gochujang.</li>
                <li>Add chicken thighs to marinade. Toss and turn until thoroughly coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator, at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours. </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish with 1 teaspoon sesame oil.</li>
                <li>Lay rice vermicelli in the dish, pulling the dry noodles apart as you do, to cover the bottom evenly, breaking off sections of noodle as needed. </li>
                <li>Evenly scatter over mushrooms, peppers, and about half the green onions. Top with marinated chicken thighs, smooth side up. Spoon excess marinade on top of chicken.</li>
                <li>Rinse marinade bowl with chicken broth and pour into the bottom of dish, without rinsing marinade off chicken. Top with a few tablespoons of green onions.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Remove chicken to a plate. Toss noodles and veggies in pan until evenly combined. Add the remaining 1/4 cup rice vinegar and 2 tablespoons sesame oil; toss one last time. Taste for seasoning. </li>
                <li>Serve chicken over noodles; sprinkle with sesame seeds and more green onions.</li>
            </ol>
